URGENT: Stop violence against children in Iran

---

## Email body (copy & paste)

Dear Members of the Committee on the Rights of the Child,

We urgently call on the international community to take immediate action to stop violence against children in Iran.

The killing of children, the use of excessive force by state security forces, and the arrest and detention of children and adolescents in Iran constitute a clear and serious violation of the fundamental principles of child rights, Iran’s own domestic laws, and its international obligations, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).

The Convention on the Rights of the Child emphasizes the obligation of states to protect children, ensure their care, and apply rehabilitative and restorative approaches when dealing with children, while explicitly rejecting punitive, coercive, and criminal approaches toward minors. The violent, repressive, and punitive treatment of children by Iranian authorities is in direct contradiction to these principles.

The Iranian government has demonstrated a complete lack of commitment to respecting the basic human rights of children within its own society. This is despite the fact that Iran signed and ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1994, alongside 193 other countries, under the auspices of the United Nations.

Through this communication, we formally submit our complaint to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child and call for urgent international investigation and intervention.

We respectfully request that the Committee:

Publicly condemn all forms of violence against children in Iran,

Investigate the killing, arrest, and ill-treatment of children and adolescents,

Demand the immediate and unconditional release of all detained children and juveniles in Iran,

Hold Iranian authorities accountable for their violations of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Silence in the face of violence against children enables further abuse. We urge you to act swiftly and decisively to protect the lives, dignity, and rights of children in Iran.

Sincerely,  
A child rights advocate
