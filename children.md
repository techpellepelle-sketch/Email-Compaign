**Subject:**  
URGENT: Stop violence against children in Iran

**Body:**

Dear Members of the Committee on the Rights of the Child,

We urgently call on the international community to take immediate action to stop violence against children in Iran.

The killing of children, the use of excessive force by state security forces, and the arrest and detention of children and adolescents constitute a clear and serious violation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

The Convention emphasizes protection, care, and restorative approaches toward children, and explicitly rejects punitive, coercive, and criminal treatment of minors. Iran’s actions stand in direct contradiction to these principles, despite having ratified the CRC in 1994.

Through this email, we formally submit a complaint and call for urgent international investigation and intervention.

We respectfully urge you to:
- Publicly condemn all forms of violence against children in Iran  
- Demand the immediate and unconditional release of all detained children and adolescents  
- Hold Iranian authorities accountable for violations of international law  

Silence enables further abuse. Please act urgently.

Sincerely,  
A child rights advocate
